# To use the package:
i). Clone the vehicle recognition repository
```
git@192.168.1.32:Data_Analytics/Vehicle_Recognition.git
```
ii). Navigate into the folder housing the newly created clone repository
```
cd Vehicle_Recognition/
```
iii). Build wheel
```
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
```
iv). Pip install wheel (wheel located in <code>Vehicle_Recognition/dist/</code> directory that's created during the build process)
```
pip3 install wheel_file_path.whl
```

NOTE: models have been removed from the library and hence the resultant wheel generated incorporates no models. The models are contained in the <code>models/</code> directory. Copy them to a suitable location and pass the paths to these models as arguments when using the library.
