# Project Alice CLI

This is a Project Alice command line tool.

It simplifies to the maximum the installation and maintenance of Project Alice.

It is not meant to be installed on the device that runs/will run Alice, but on your main computer.

It handles connecting to network discoverable devices through SSH and generates RSA keys for a passwordless connection.

Although it's a command line tool, made possible thanks to the awesome "Click" package, it is using the wonderful "InquirerPy" package, a reboot of the deprecated "PyInquirer", to offer an interactive menu for people not used or wanting to type commands.

# Users

`pip3 install projectalice-cli`

Note that you need Python 3.8 at least
