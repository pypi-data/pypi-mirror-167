HAMSAY

What is this?
    A stupid thing based in pycowsay (https://github.com/cs01/pycowsay)
    that just exists because I need to configure a couple of things in VS Code.
    It is a fat hamster talking made in a saturday afternoon instead being happy.

There are some options:

[MESSAGE]               A fat hamster saying something.
--hamster [MESSAGE]     The same fat hamster saying something.
--pervert [MESSAGE]     A message not for kids.
--version               You check the version of this thing
--help                  That is what you need. And this.
--sebi                  Me.
      """


def sebi():
    """ME ME ME ME ME"""
    return "Sebastardo has a lot of work, he shouldn't be doing this."
