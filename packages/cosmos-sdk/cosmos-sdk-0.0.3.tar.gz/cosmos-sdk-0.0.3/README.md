# Python SDK for the Cosmos Ecosystem

<p><sub>(Unfamiliar with Cosmos?  <a href="https://docs.terra.money/">Check out the Cosmos Network Docs</a>)</sub></p>

This (SDK) in Python is a simple library toolkit for building software that can interact with the supported Cosmos blockchains and provides simple abstractions over core data structures, serialization, key management, and API request generation.

Note - This is currently a W.I.P.

## Features

- This SDK follows a module specific approach, and new Cosmos Modules will be added to the SDK on a priority basis.
- Written in Python with extensive support libraries
- Versatile support for key management solutions

‚ùó This SDK currently does not support Terra Classic. If you want to communicate with Terra Classic, use terra-sdk==2.x

## Requirements

Cosmos.py SDK requires <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python v3.7+</a>.

## Installation

<sub>**NOTE:** _All code starting with a `$` is meant to run on your terminal (a bash prompt). All code starting with a `>>>` is meant to run in a python interpreter, like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipython/">ipython</a>._</sub>

Cosmos SDK can be installed (preferably in a `virtual environment` from PyPI using `pip`) as follows:
  
```
$ pip install -U cosmos_SDK
```

<sub>_You might have `pip3` installed instead of `pip`; proceed according to your own setup._<sub>

## Usage Examples

```
from cosmos_sdk.client.lcd import LCDClient
from cosmos_sdk.key.mnemonic import MnemonicKey

mnemonic = <MNEMONIC_PHRASE>

# Terra client
terra_client = LCDClient(chain_id="phoenix-1", url="https://phoenix-lcd.terra.dev")
mk = MnemonicKey(mnemonic,"terra")
terra_wallet = terra_client.wallet(mk)

# Persistence client
persistence_client = LCDClient(chain_id="core-1", url="http://rest.core.persistence.one")
mk = MnemonicKey(mnemonic,"persistence")
persistence_wallet = persistence_client.wallet(mk)
```


## Dependencies

Cosmos SDK uses <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> to manage dependencies. To get set up with all the required dependencies, run:

```
$ pip install poetry
$ poetry install
```

If you encounter "version solving failed." error, try `poetry add <package_name>`, followed by `poetry lock` and then `poetry install`
