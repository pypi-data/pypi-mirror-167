# Type Stubs for QGIS

This package defines Python stub files (.pyi) for the PyQGIS wrapper module available in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/).

## Overview

The bulk of the `qgis` module is a [SIP](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/sip/)-generated wrapper over a C++ source, which cannot be introspected by the user or development utilities.

Python type stubs are a declaration-only replication of the C/C++ interface that can be parsed by IDEs, linters, or static type checkers like [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) or [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) to provide the same functionality available for regular Python sources.

## Installation

qgis-stubs can be installed through pip:

```sh
$ python -m pip install qgis-stubs
```

Alternatively, you can clone and install them straight from this repository:

```sh
$ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/leonhard-s/qgis-stubs.git
```

## Limitations

This project is in early stages and does not yet cover the full interface. This is largely due to QGIS doing a lot of monkey-patching that is not yet automatically replicated in the stub files.

Here is a likely incomplete list of known limitations/omissions:

- Compatibility fallbacks and non-standard attributes may be missing (as they are monkey patched).
- Most methods do not contain docstrings (these too are monkey-patched).
- None of the types and utilities defined in the `core.additions` namespace are available as they mostly serve to allow for more monkey-patching.
- QGIS enumerators clutter the parent namespace, which can lead to name collisions.

  For example: The value `QgsAggregateMappingModel.ColumnDataIndex.Aggregate` instead escalates to `QgsAggregateMappingModel.Aggregate`, which is subsequently overwritten by an inner class of the same qualified name.

  Such names are inaccessible in the stubs and possibly even at runtime. I did not yet have time to investigate further.

## Contributing

If you encounter any issues such as missing or incorrect hints or other unexpected behaviour, please do not hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/leonhard-s/qgis-stubs/issues) or start hacking away.

The current version of this package was created with copious amounts of RegEx-based edits and refactoring tools, though I did end up manually merging files and adding missing types a lot.

If this utility is useful to you, please let me know and I will happily look into automating the entire workflow to keep this package synchronised with QGIS releases.
