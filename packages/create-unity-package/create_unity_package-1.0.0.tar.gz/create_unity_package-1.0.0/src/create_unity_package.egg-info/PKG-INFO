This is a simple command line tool that automates the creation of
Unity packages. It creates the boilerplate package structure and
inserts user-specific information. This package is inspired by
other developer CLI tools such as CreateReactApp.

This application follows the instructions offered by
[Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPackages.html). It
creates new local packages in the directory that the application
is run.

Good luck with your development!
