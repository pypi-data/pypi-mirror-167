# Dragodis

Dragodis is a Python framework which allows for the creation of
universal disassembler scripts.  Dragodis currently only supports
IDA and Ghidra, but has plans to support additional disassemblers
in the future.  Dragodis only supports Python 3.

The name `Dragodis` comes from the combination of `Dragoman`, a professional
interpreter, and `Disassembler`.

Dragodis was created due to a need of the ability to run IDA scripts in
Ghidra. Many scripts for automated analysis will work fine in most disassemblers.
Eliminating the need to use disassemblers which require licenses for automated
analysis is ideal.

There are other benefits of a universal disassembler API as well. Many reverse
engineers have a preferred disassembler. Dragodis allows for simple transfers
of scripts between users of different disassemblers. Dragodis also aims to provide
a cleaner and easier to use API than those provided by other disassemblers.


## Usage

To use Dragodis, simply pass in the path to your input binary file into either the `IDA` or `Ghidra` class.
This will create an instance of the disassembler with the given input file analyzed.

```python
import dragodis

with dragodis.Ghidra(r"C:\strings.exe") as ghidra:
    print(ghidra.get_dword(0x401000))
```

```python
import dragodis

with dragodis.IDA(r"C:\strings.exe") as ida:
    print(ida.get_dword(0x401000))
```

A disassembler can also be run without using a context manager using the `start()` and `stop()` functions.

```python
import dragodis

ghidra = dragodis.Ghidra(r"C:\strings.exe")
ghidra.start()
ghidra.get_dword(0x401000)
ghidra.stop()
```

Alternatively, you can use `open_program()` to choose the disassembler more dynamically by providing
the disassembler name in the `disassembler` parameter or by setting the `DRAGODIS_DISASSEMBLER`
environment variable.

```python
import dragodis

with dragodis.open_program(r"C:\strings.exe", disassembler="ida") as ida:
    print(ida.get_dword(0x401000))
```

It is highly recommended to use the `DRAGODIS_DISASSEMBLER` environment variable to ensure your scripts
are cross compatible without any modification. As well, to give the user the power to choose
which disassembler they would like to use.


```{note} 
A "NotInstalledError" will be thrown if the disassembler chosen is not properly installed.
```

```python
import os
os.environ["DRAGODIS_DISASSEMBLER"] = "ida"

import dragodis

with dragodis.open_program(r"C:\strings.exe") as dis:
    print(f"Disassembler used: {dis.name}")
    print(dis.get_dword(0x401000))
```

If you are locally within the disassembler's interpreter (the output window for IDA or pyhidraw interpreter in Ghidra)
then you can initialize a disassembler object by directly acccessing the object:

```python
# If in IDA
import dragodis
dis = dragodis.IDA()

# If in Ghidra
import dragodis
dis = dragodis.Ghidra()
```

We can also directly call scripts that using the `open_program()` function locally in the disassembler.
When this happens, the input file path provided must match the detected input file path by the disassembler.
