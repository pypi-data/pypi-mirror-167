Description: # Input Parser
        
        The input-parser module allows you to easily write scripts requiring user interaction.
        
        The input function allows you to define the response it expects from the user so it can parse out any incorrect responses and request a new one.
        It automatically generates failure messages for the user.
        
        ## Compatibility
        
        input-parser is being developed with Python 3.8, but is likely to work on older versions (and will be tested when completed).
        
        ## Installation
        
        This package currently isn't on PyPi so cannot be installed.
        This will be available soon.
        In the meantime, simply copy the `src/input-parser/parser.py` file to your project.
        
        ## Usage
        
        The module contains only one function called `parse_input()`.
        This has two required arguments, the message and the type.
        The message will be shown to the user when requesting an input.
        The class represents the type of the input required.
        At the moment, you can only specify one type, but I plan to allow more to be set in a future update.
        
        ## Bugs
        
        If you find a bug in input-parser, probably just create a GitHub issue, bearing in mind that this is still a work in progress, so I've probably already spotted the bug but haven't got around to fixing it.
