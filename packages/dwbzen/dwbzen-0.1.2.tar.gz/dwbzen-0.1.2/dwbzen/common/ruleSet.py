        Each substitution is a dict. The key is a regular expression string used to match an input string,
        for example: (interval)/(quarterLength-multiplier)
        The value is the replacement. The re groups are named and can be referenced in the replacement.
        splitter is a regular expression, analagous to a string splitter, that will split the
        substitution result into named components.
