class AffineTransformationModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

This modifier applies an affine transformation to data elements in order to move, rotate, shear or scale them.
See also the corresponding user manual page for more information.

Inputs:

The modifier can operate on any combination of the following data elements:

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Data element specifier
      - Description
    * - ``particles``
      - Transforms the ``Position`` particle property.
    * - ``vector_properties``
      - Transforms the vectorial particle properties ``Velocity``, ``Force``, and ``Displacement``.
    * - ``cell``
      - Transforms the :py:class:`SimulationCell`.
    * - ``surfaces``
      - Transforms the vertices of all :py:class:`SurfaceMesh` and :py:class:`TriangleMesh` objects.
    * - ``dislocations``
      - Transforms all dislocation lines in a :py:class:`DislocationNetwork`.
    * - ``voxels``
      - Transforms the spatial :py:attr:`domain` of all :py:class:`VoxelGrid` objects.

The modifier will act on all of these by default. You can restrict the transform to a subset of data objects by setting the :py:attr:`operate_on` field.

Examples:

The following code applies a simple shear transformation to all particle coordinates. The shear transformation is specified
as a 3x3 matrix with ones on the matrix diagonal and an off-diagonal element that is non-zero.
No translation is applied to the particles. Thus all elements in the fourth column of the extended 3x4 affine transformation 
matrix are set to zero:

    ```python
  xy_shear = 0.05
  mod = AffineTransformationModifier(
          operate_on = {'particles'}, # Transform particles but not the box.
          transformation = [[1, xy_shear, 0, 0],
                            [0,        1, 0, 0],
                            [0,        0, 1, 0]])
```

Note that the modifier itself only supports static transformations, which
remain constant over the entire trajectory. However, is possible to employ the :py:class:`AffineTransformationModifier`
in a :ref:`user-defined modifier function <writing_custom_modifiers>`, which calculates the transformation matrix dynamically
at each animation frame: 

    ```python
  import numpy as np
  
  def rotate(frame, data):
      theta = np.deg2rad(frame * 5.0)  # time-dependent angle of rotation
      tm = [[np.cos(theta), -np.sin(theta), 0, 0],
            [np.sin(theta),  np.cos(theta), 0, 0],
            [            0,              0, 1, 0]]
      # Execute AffineTransformationModifier as a sub-operation:
      data.apply(AffineTransformationModifier(transformation = tm))
  
  pipeline.modifiers.append(rotate)
```"""

    @property
    def reduced_coords(self) -> bool:

Here, :math:`\\mathbf{M}` refers to the 3x3 linear part of the affine :py:attr:`.transformation` matrix and :math:`\\mathbf{t}` to the translational part (fourth matrix column).

class AssignColorModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

This modifier assigns a uniform color to all selected data elements.
See also the corresponding user manual page for more information.
The modifier can operate on different data elements:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 75
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Data element
      -
    * - ``particles``

    * - ``bonds``
      - Sets the ``Color`` property of selected bonds.
    * - ``surface_vertices``
      - Sets the ``Color`` property of selected vertices of a :py:class:`SurfaceMesh` structure.
    * - ``surface_faces``
      - Sets the ``Color`` property of selected faces of a :py:class:`SurfaceMesh` structure.
    * - ``surface_regions``
      - Sets the ``Color`` property of selected spatial regions of a :py:class:`SurfaceMesh` structure.

By default the modifier will act on particles. You can change this by setting the :py:attr:`operate_on` field.
The modifier uses the input :py:class:`Property` named ``Selection`` to determine which subset of data elements should
be assigned the specified :py:attr:`color`. Data elements whose ``Selection`` property is zero, keep their current color. 
In case the ``Selection`` property does not exist at all, the modifier assigns the color to every data element.

OVITO provides various modifiers for creating selections: :py:class:`SelectTypeModifier`, :py:class:`ExpressionSelectionModifier`,
:py:class:`SliceModifier`, :py:class:`InvertSelectionModifier`.

Examples

Select some particles with the :py:class:`SelectTypeModifier` and give them a new color:

    ```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(SelectTypeModifier(types={1,3}))
  pipeline.modifiers.append(AssignColorModifier(color=(1.0, 0.3, 0.3)))
```

Use the :py:class:`CalculateDisplacementsModifier` to calculate the atomic displacement vectors and visualize them
as arrows in rendered images. Particularly large displacement arrows can be highlighted using the :py:class:`AssignColorModifier`:

    ```python
  # Calculate and visualize atomic displacement vectors:
  modifier = CalculateDisplacementsModifier()
  modifier.vis.enabled = True
  pipeline.modifiers.append(modifier)
  
  # Select particles with large displacement magnitudes:
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ExpressionSelectionModifier(expression='DisplacementMagnitude > 1.2'))
  # Highlight large displacement vectors using a special color: 
  pipeline.modifiers.append(AssignColorModifier(operate_on='vectors', color=(0.0, 0.9, 1.0)))

class BondAnalysisModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

Computes the bond angle distribution and the bond length distribution for the particle system with bonds.
See the corresponding user manual page for more information on this modifier.

The input for this modifier must contain a :py:class:`Bonds` data object with the bond topology information,
which may either be loaded from the simulation file or by first inserting the :py:class:`CreateBondsModifier`
into the pipeline.

The modifier outputs the computed bond length and bond angle histograms as two :py:class:`DataTable` objects,
which may be exported to an output text file using the :py:func:`export_file` function or retrieved 
from the pipeline's output data collection, see the `DataCollection.tables` dictionary

      - The bond angle distribution histogram computed by the modifier. 
    * - ``bond-length-distr``
      - The bond length distribution histogram computed by the modifier. 

Examples:

The following Python script demonstrates how to load a particle system (without bond topology) from a file, 
create the bond topology using OVITO's :py:class:`CreateBondsModifier`, and then compute
the bond angle distribution. Finally, the histogram is written to an output text file using the :py:func:`export_file` function.

```python
  from ovito.io import import_file, export_file
  from ovito.modifiers import BondAnalysisModifier, CreateBondsModifier
  
  # Set up data pipeline:
  pipeline = import_file('input/simulation.dump')
  pipeline.modifiers.append(CreateBondsModifier(cutoff = 3.2))
  pipeline.modifiers.append(BondAnalysisModifier(bins = 100))
  
  # Export bond angle distribution to an output text file.
  export_file(pipeline, 'output/bond_angles.txt', 'txt/table', key='bond-angle-distr')
  
  # Convert bond length histogram to a NumPy array and print it to the terminal.
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.tables['bond-length-distr'].xy())
```

The script above computes the instantaneous distribution for the initial frame in the simulation file only.
To compute an average bond angle distribution for the entire MD trajectory, you can make use of the

Assigns colors to data elements to visualize the discrete per-element values of a typed property, e.g. the residue type or structural type of particles.

    * - ``voxels``
      - Colors :py:class:`VoxelGrid` cells according to a typed property.

By default the modifier will act on particles. You can change this by setting the :py:attr:`operate_on` field.

The modifier's :py:attr:`property` field names the input property according to which the data elements will be colored.
It must be a so-called *typed property*, which means the :py:class:`Property` object has a list of :py:class:`ElementType`
instances attached in its :py:attr:`types` field, defining the mapping of integer values in the property array to element type colors.
Each :py:class:`ElementType` instance associates one numeric :py:attr:`id` with
a corresponding :py:attr:`color`.

Output:

The modifier sets the ``Color`` property of the data elements it operates on. When rendering a picture,
this property determines the visual color of the individual objects.

Examples:

```python
  from ovito.io import import_file
  from ovito.modifiers import ColorByTypeModifier
  
  # Load a GROMACS file, which contains the 'Residue Type' particle property.
  pipeline = import_file("input/1AKI.gro")
  pipeline.add_to_scene()
  
  # Print a table of all residue types defined in the dataset:
  for residue_type in pipeline.compute().particles['Residue Type'].types:
      print(residue_type.id, residue_type.name, residue_type.color)
  
  # Apply the ColorByTypeModifier, giving particles a color based on 
  # the value of their 'Residue Type' property:
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ColorByTypeModifier(
      operate_on='particles', 
      property='Residue Type'))
```

One way to change the colors of the element types is to prepend the :py:class:`ColorByTypeModifier` in the pipeline with a :ref:`user-defined modifier function <writing_custom_modifiers>`
configuring the :py:class:`ElementType` instances that are attached to the typed :py:class:`Property`:

```python
  def setup_residue_colors(frame, data):
      residues = data.particles_['Residue Type_']
      residues.type_by_name_('LYS').color = (1.0, 0.0, 1.0)
      residues.type_by_name_('GLU').color = (0.0, 0.5, 1.0)
  pipeline.modifiers.insert(0, setup_residue_colors)
```

Implementation:

The :py:class:`ColorByTypeModifier` is functionally equivalent to (but more efficient than) the following :ref:`user-defined modifier function <writing_custom_modifiers>`:

```python
  def color_by_type(frame, data, property_name='Residue Type'):
      input_property = data.particles[property_name]

class ConstructSurfaceModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

Constructs the geometric surface of the solid region formed by point-like particles. The modifier generates
a :py:class:`SurfaceMesh`, which is a closed manifold consisting of triangular elements. It can further compute the
surface area and the volume of the region enclosed by the surface mesh as well as empty pores in the interior of the
filled region. See the corresponding user manual page
for more information.

Basic usage example:

```python
  from ovito.io import import_file
  from ovito.modifiers import ConstructSurfaceModifier
  
  pipeline = import_file("input/simulation.dump")
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ConstructSurfaceModifier(radius = 2.9))
  data = pipeline.compute()
  surface_mesh = data.surfaces['surface']
```

Alpha-shape method:

The modifier supports two different construction methods for the surface, which are selected by setting the :py:attr:`method`
parameter. The ``AlphaShape`` method uses a Delaunay tessellation constructed on the basis of the input particle coordinates
to identify volume elements that cannot fully accommodate a virtual probe sphere of a given radius and which are thus classified as being
part of the filled (or solid) region. The :py:attr:`radius` parameter controls the size of the virtual probe sphere and determines how 
much detail of the morphology are resolved during the surface construction. A larger radius leads to a surface with fewer details, 
reflecting only coarse features of the surface morphology. A small radius, on the other hand, will resolve finer surface features and 
small pores in the interior of a solid, for example.

See `[A. Stukowski, JOM 66 (2014), 399-407] <http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11837-013-0827-5>`_ for a description of the alpha-shape surface 
construction algorithm. Please cite this paper when publishing analysis results obtained with the help of OVITO.

Gaussian density method:

The second surface construction method supported by the modifier is based on the smeared-out representation of the point-like 
particles as overlapping Gaussian distribution functions centered on each particle site. The density field has local maximums  
at the particle centers and decays to zero far away from any particles. The surface mesh representation is then constructed as an isosurface
of the Gaussian density field, with the threshold :py:attr:`isolevel` chosen such that the resulting surface roughly represents the finite diameters of the input
particle spheres. 

```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ConstructSurfaceModifier(
      method = ConstructSurfaceModifier.Method.GaussianDensity,
      radius_scaling = 1.2,
      isolevel = 0.5))
```

Volume analysis:

The ``AlphaShape`` method provides the option to compute volume and surface area of the solid region formed by the input particles.
Furthermore, it allows identifying pores inside the solid and to compute their respective volumes and interior surface areas. 
To enable this extra calculation step, set :py:attr:`identify_regions` to ``True``. The modifier will output various
aggregate values such as the total surface area and the pore volume fraction as global attributes, 
see the table below.

```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ConstructSurfaceModifier(
      method = ConstructSurfaceModifier.Method.AlphaShape,
      radius = 2.9,
      identify_regions = True))
  
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print("Surface area: %f" % data.attributes['ConstructSurfaceMesh.surface_area'])
  print("Solid volume: %f" % data.attributes['ConstructSurfaceMesh.filled_volume'])
```

This option generates a new per-particle property named ``Region`` specifying the indices of the spatial regions the particles are located it. A particle located exactly on the boundary between a filled and an empty region is always attributed to the filled region. Note, however, that a particle located fully inside an empty region will be attributed to that empty region. 

The mapping of particles to regions happens *before* the surface smoothing stage, which means particles may appear slightly outside of the region they were attributed to, because the vertices of the final surface mesh are displaced by the smoothing procedure. You can turn surface smoothing off by setting :py:attr:`smoothing_level` to 0. 

The modifier will try to assign all particles to spatial regions - even the unselected ones when the :py:attr:`only_selected` option is turned on and the surface is being constructed only for a subset of the particles. 

The :py:attr:`map_particles_to_regions` option is only supported by the ``AlphaShape`` surface construction :py:attr:`method`. Furthermore, the :py:attr:`identify_regions` option must be turned on; or otherwise this option has no effect.

```python
  # Construct surface mesh around the subset of currently selected particles.

      only_selected = True, identify_regions = True, map_particles_to_regions = True))

Constructs coordination polyhedra around selected particles for visualization purposes.
See the corresponding user manual page
for more information. A coordination polyhedron is the convex hull constructed from the neighbor atoms

In order to tell the modifier which input particles should be surrounded by a coordination polyhedron,
the central particles must be selected first. The particle selection can be created by inserting a 
:py:class:`SelectTypeModifier` into the data pipeline prior to this modifier. 

The modifier furthermore requires input bonds connecting a central particle with its neighbors 
to define which atoms the algorithm should use in the construction of the convex hulls.
You can insert the :py:class:`CreateBondsModifier` prior to this modifier to let OVITO dynamically generate
neighbor bonds between particles.

Example:

```python
  # Import simulation dataset and add it to the scene:
  pipeline = import_file("input/simulation.0.dump")
  pipeline.add_to_scene()
  
  # Select all atoms of species type 1. They will form the centers of the polyhedra.

  # Create bonds between nearby atoms.
  pipeline.modifiers.append(CreateBondsModifier(cutoff=3.0))

The modifier takes an existing :py:class:`VoxelGrid` as input, for example a charge density
field loaded from an input simulation file or a three-dimensional voxel grid dynamically

the name of the field :py:class:`Property` for which to construct the isosurface, because
multiple fields may be defined on the same voxel grid.

    ```python
  # Import a charge density field from a VASP calculation:
  pipeline = import_file("input/CHGCAR.nospin.gz")
  pipeline.add_to_scene()
  
  # The identifier of the imported VoxelGrid is 'charge-density',

class ElasticStrainModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

This modifier computes the atomic-level elastic strain and deformation gradient tensors in crystalline systems.
See also the corresponding user manual page for this modifier.

The modifier first performs an identification of the local crystal structure and stores the results in the ``Structure Type`` particle
property. Possible structure type values are listed under the :py:attr:`input_crystal_structure` property.
Atoms that do not form a crystalline structure or which are part of defects are assigned the special type ``OTHER`` (=0).
For these atoms the local elastic deformation cannot be computed.

If :py:attr:`calculate_deformation_gradients` is set to true, the modifier outputs a new particle property named ``Elastic Deformation Gradient``,
which contains the per-atom elastic deformation gradient tensors. Each tensor has nine components stored in column-major order.
Atoms for which the elastic deformation gradient could not be determined (i.e. which are classified as ``OTHER``) will be assigned the null tensor.

If :py:attr:`calculate_strain_tensors` is set to true, the modifier outputs a new particle property named ``Elastic Strain``,
which contains the per-atom elastic strain tensors. Each symmetric strain tensor has six components stored in the order XX, YY, ZZ, XY, XZ, YZ.
Atoms for which the elastic strain tensor could not be determined (i.e. which are classified as ``OTHER``) will be assigned the null tensor.

Furthermore, the modifier generates a particle property ``Volumetric Strain``, which stores the trace divided by three of the local elastic strain tensor.
Atoms for which the elastic strain tensor could not be determined (i.e. which are classified as ``OTHER``) will be assigned a value of zero.

Selects data elements, e.g. particles, based on a user-defined Boolean expression. 
This modifier can be inserted into a :py:class:`Pipeline` to create a selection
set. which subsequent modifiers in the pipeline can operate on.

See also the corresponding user manual page for more information on this modifier.
The modifier can select different kinds of data elements depending on the value of its :py:attr:`operate_on` property:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 25 75
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Operate on

    * - ``particles`` (default)
      - Selects particles based on a user-defined criterion.
    * - ``bonds``
      - Selects bonds based on a user-defined criterion.
    * - ``surface_regions``
      - Selects volumetric regions of a :py:class:`SurfaceMesh` based on a user-defined criterion.

Outputs:

The modifier sets or updates the value of the ``Selection`` property of each data element: 1 if 
the expression evaluates to true for an element; 0 otherwise.

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Global attributes
      -
    * - ``ExpressionSelection.count``
      - The number of data elements (particles/bonds) that have been selected by the modifier.

Usage example:

The following code example demonstrates how to select all atoms whose potential energy 
exceeds a threshold value of -3.6 eV. After executing the pipeline, the number of atoms that got selected
may be queried by inspecting the global attribute ``ExpressionSelection.count``,
which was created by the modifier as summarized output:

```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ExpressionSelectionModifier(expression = 'PotentialEnergy > -3.6'))
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.attributes['ExpressionSelection.count'])
```

Note that, in many cases, the :py:class:`ExpressionSelectionModifier` class can be replaced with an equivalent
:ref:`user-defined modifier function <writing_custom_modifiers>` creating the selection directly.
The example above can be reimplemented without a :py:class:`ExpressionSelectionModifier` as follows:

```python
  def select_atoms(frame, data):
      sel = data.particles['Potential Energy'] > -3.6
      data.particles_.create_property('Selection', data=sel)
  pipeline.modifiers.append(select_atoms)
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(numpy.count_nonzero(data.particles['Selection']))
```

In this second version, the selection criterion is specified in terms of a native Python expression operating on a NumPy array
containing particle property values, which means you are no longer limited to the simple language supported by :py:class:`ExpressionSelectionModifier`.
NumPy expressions allow you to directly and efficiently compute the ``Selection`` property array and thereby establish the output selection set.

Furthermore, if you just want to count the number of particles that fulfill a certain criterion, it may not even be necessary to create a selection. 
You can directly use NumPy's `count_nonzero() <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.count_nonzero.html>`__
function to determine the number of particles for which some Boolean expression evaluates to true:

```python
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(numpy.count_nonzero(data.particles['Potential Energy'] > -3.6))
```"""

    @property
    def expression(self) -> str:
        """The Boolean expression to be evaluated by the modifier for each data element, formatted as a Python string. The expression syntax is documented in :ref:`OVITO's user manual <manual:particles.modifiers.expression_select>`; it is *not* regular Python syntax. The string's contents will be parsed by OVITO's integrated math expression interpreter (`muparser <https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/>`__). 

.. note::

  Keep in mind that the Boolean expression is subject to special syntax rules.   Because variable identifiers cannot contain spaces, spaces occurring in particle property names must be omitted.   For example, the particle property `Potential Energy` must be referred to as ``PotentialEnergy`` in the expression string. 

Note that you can incorporate the values of regular Python variables in the expression simply by using Python's `string formatting <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals>`__ technique, e.g. 

```python
  threshold = float(sys.argv[1])
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ExpressionSelectionModifier(expression = f"ShearStrain>{threshold}"))
```

The generated string that the modifier sees contains just a constant literal in place of the original Python variable reference. Furthermore, it is possible to update the expression string *after* the modifier was inserted into the pipeline. Re-evaluating the data pipeline will recompute the selection, letting you perform several calculations in a for-loop, for example: 

```python
  modifier = ExpressionSelectionModifier()
  pipeline.modifiers.append(modifier)
  for threshold in numpy.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.05):
      modifier.expression = f"ShearStrain>{threshold}"

class LoadTrajectoryModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

This modifier loads trajectories of particles from a separate simulation file.
See also the corresponding user manual page for this modifier.

The typical use case for this modifier is when the topology of a molecular system (i.e. the definition of atom types, bonds, etc.) is
stored separately from the trajectories of atoms. In this case you should load the topology file first using :py:func:`import_file`.
Then create and apply the :py:class:`LoadTrajectoryModifier` to the topology dataset, which loads the trajectory file.
The modifier will replace the static atom positions from the topology dataset with the time-dependent positions from the trajectory file.

Example:

```python
  from ovito.io import import_file
  from ovito.modifiers import LoadTrajectoryModifier
  
  # Load static topology data from a LAMMPS data file.
  pipeline = import_file('input/input.data', atom_style='bond')
  
  # Load atom trajectories from separate LAMMPS dump file.
  traj_mod = LoadTrajectoryModifier()
  traj_mod.source.load('input/trajectory.dump')
  print("Number of frames: ", traj_mod.source.num_frames)
  
  # Insert modifier into data pipeline.
  pipeline.modifiers.append(traj_mod)
```

Furthermore, it is possible to let the modifier load varying bond topologies
for each trajectory frame from a LAMMPS `dump local <https://docs.lammps.org/dump.html>`__ file:

```python
  bonds_mod = LoadTrajectoryModifier()
  bonds_mod.source.load('input/bonds.dump.local', 
      columns = [None, 'Bond Type', 'Particle Identifiers.1', 'Particle Identifiers.2', 'Length', 'Energy'])
  pipeline.modifiers.append(bonds_mod)
```

Here, the ``columns`` function parameter specifies the mapping of data columns in the imported dump file to corresponding
target bond properties within OVITO. The dump local file :file:`bonds.dump.local` contains six data columns 
and has been produced by the following LAMMPS commands::

   compute 1 all property/local btype batom1 batom2
   compute 2 all bond/local dist engpot
   dump bonds all local 100 bonds.dump.local index c_1[1] c_1[2] c_1[3] c_2[1] c_2[2]"""

class SpatialBinningModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):

This modifier maps the particles to a bin grid and applies a reduction operation (mean, sum, min, max, etc.) to some property of 
the particles located within each spatial bin. The modifier outputs a one-, two- or three-dimensional grid of field values. 
See also the corresponding user manual page for more information on this modifier. 

The :py:attr:`direction` parameter of the modifier selects the dimensionality of the bin grid and the 
spatial direction(s) along which the grid cells are oriented. The :py:attr:`bin_count` parameter controls the resolution
of the generated grid, which always covers the entire :py:class:`SimulationCell`.
Finally, you have to specify the input particle property which should be transferred to the grid cell by setting the modifier's
:py:attr:`property` field to the name of an existing particle property. 

If the dimensionality of the selected output grid is one-dimensional, then the modifier will generate a :py:class:`DataTable` object
containing the computed bin values along the selected spatial :py:attr:`direction`. The data table may later be retrieved from the 
:py:attr:`tables` dictionary of the pipeline's output :py:class:`DataCollection` 
under the look-up key ``'binning'``.

If the dimensionality of the selected output grid is two- or three-dimensional, then the modifier will generate a :py:class:`VoxelGrid` object.
The generated voxel grid may later be retrieved from the :py:attr:`grids` dictionary of the pipeline's output 
:py:class:`DataCollection` under the look-up key ``'binning'``.

Examples

The following example shows how to calculate the gradient of the ``Velocity.X`` field along the spatial Z-axis.
For this, we use the :py:attr:`first_derivative` option, which lets the modifier compute the first derivative of the 
data points using a finite differences scheme.

```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(SpatialBinningModifier(
      property = 'Velocity.X',
      direction = SpatialBinningModifier.Direction.Z, 
      bin_count = 80,
      reduction_operation = SpatialBinningModifier.Operation.Mean,
      first_derivative = True
  ))
```

The output :py:class:`DataTable` can then be exported to an output file using OVITO's :py:func:`export_file`
function or printed to the console:

```python
  export_file(pipeline, 'output/velocity_profile.txt', 'txt/table', key='binning')
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.tables['binning'].xy())
```

The following example demonstrates how to compute a three-dimensional :py:class:`VoxelGrid` of the particle number density.
Since the :py:class:`SpatialBinningModifier` always requires some input particle property, we first employ the 
:py:class:`ComputePropertyModifier` to give all particles a new property with the uniform value 1, which can then
serve as input property for the binning:

```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ComputePropertyModifier(expressions=['1'], output_property='Unity'))
  
  pipeline.modifiers.append(SpatialBinningModifier(
      property = 'Unity',
      direction = SpatialBinningModifier.Direction.XYZ, 
      bin_count = (100, 100, 100),
      reduction_operation = SpatialBinningModifier.Operation.SumVol
  ))
```

The resulting :py:class:`VoxelGrid` may now be exported to an output file, for example in the VTK format:

```python
  export_file(pipeline, 'output/density.vtk', 'vtk/grid', key='binning')
```

Or it can serve as input for subsequent modifiers in your data pipeline, for example the :py:class:`CreateIsosurfaceModifier`."""

class TimeAveragingModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

This modifier can compute the time average of one or more time-dependent input quantities by sampling them over all frames of the loaded trajectory.
The input quantities to be averaged can be any time-varying attribute or :py:class:`DataTable` generated on a frame-by-frame basis by 
another modifier in the OVITO data pipeline. Or it can be per-element values, for example particle properties.
See also the corresponding user manual page for more information on this modifier. 

Averaging scalar quantities:

The following code example demonstrates how to use the :py:class:`TimeAveragingModifier` to calculate the mean value of
a scalar quantity that changes with simulation time. In this example, the :py:class:`CreateBondsModifier` is 
added to the pipeline to dynamically create bonds between the moving particles (thus, the number of created bonds will change with time). 
The modifier reports the number of bonds that have been created in the current simulation frame as an output attribute named ``'CreateBonds.num_bonds'``. 
This varying attribute is then selected as the input quantity to be averaged by the following :py:class:`TimeAveragingModifier`, 
which in turn outputs the time-averaged value it computes as a new attribute named ``'CreateBonds.num_bonds (Average)'``. 
This value can be retrieved from the :py:class:`DataCollection` produced by `Pipeline.compute()`.
Note that is does not matter at which simulation time we evaluate the data pipeline -- the mean number of bonds is a static quantity and remains
constant over the entire trajectory.

```python
  pipeline = import_file('input/trajectory.dump')
  pipeline.modifiers.append(CreateBondsModifier(cutoff=2.9))
  pipeline.modifiers.append(TimeAveragingModifier(operate_on='attribute:CreateBonds.num_bonds'))
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.attributes['CreateBonds.num_bonds (Average)'])
```

Averaging data tables:

Some analysis modifiers of OVITO output their results as :py:class:`DataTable` objects, which can represent
histograms or distributions functions. For example, the :py:class:`CoordinationAnalysisModifier` computes
the radial pair distribution function (RDF) of a particle system for the current simulation time and outputs it as a data table
named ``'coordination-rdf'``. We can have the :py:class:`TimeAveragingModifier` compute the time average of this varying 
distribution function over all frames of the loaded trajectory: 

```python
  pipeline = import_file('input/trajectory.dump')
  pipeline.modifiers.append(CoordinationAnalysisModifier(cutoff=6.0, number_of_bins=50))
  pipeline.modifiers.append(TimeAveragingModifier(operate_on='table:coordination-rdf'))
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.tables['coordination-rdf[average]'].xy())
```

Note that, in case of data tables, the output table's :py:attr:`identifier` is given the suffix ``[average]``
by the :py:class:`TimeAveragingModifier`. 

An average of a :py:class:`DataTable` can only be computed if the table's x-axis :py:attr:`interval` does not vary with time and
the :py:attr:`x`-coordinates of the data points remain fixed. That's because the modifier simply averages the time-varying y-coordinate of each data point.
Thus, to generate a histogram :py:class:`DataTable` using the :py:class:`HistogramModifier` that is suitable for time averaging,  
you will have to activate the :py:attr:`HistogramModifier.fix_xrange` option.

Averaging properties:

The modifier can time-average properties that belong to a :py:class:`Particles` object, :py:class:`VoxelGrid`, 
or other type of :py:class:`PropertyContainer`. When setting the :py:attr:`operate_on` field, you need to specify 
the container's identifier and the name of the property to average:

```python
  pipeline.modifiers.append(TimeAveragingModifier(operate_on='property:particles/Coordination'))
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.particles['Coordination Average'][...])
```

Note that the output :py:attr:`Property` is given the suffix ``'Average'`` by the :py:class:`TimeAveragingModifier`."""

    @property
    def interval(self) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int]]:
        """The animation frame interval over which the input trajectory is sampled to compute the average. You can set this to a pair of integers specifying the first and the last frame of the averaging interval; or assign ``None`` to let the modifier compute the average over the entire trajectory. 

For example, to restrict the average to the second half of the loaded simulation trajectory, you can specify the frame interval based on the `FileSource.num_frames` value: 

```python

and outputs the generated time series as a new :py:class:`DataTable` with the identifier ``time-series``. 

```python
  pipeline = import_file('input/trajectory.dump')
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ConstructSurfaceModifier(radius = 1.9))
  pipeline.modifiers.append(TimeSeriesModifier(operate_on = 'ConstructSurfaceMesh.surface_area'))
  data = pipeline.compute()
  print(data.tables['time-series'].xy())
```

This code samples the value of the global attribute ``ConstructSurfaceMesh.surface_area``, which is computed by the :py:class:`ConstructSurfaceModifier`
for each frame of the loaded simulation trajectory. The result is a static :py:class:`DataTable` with the number of rows equal to the number
of trajectory frames, which is inserted by the :py:class:`TimeSeriesModifier` into the pipeline's output data collection.

Note that you do not need the :py:class:`TimeSeriesModifier` in order to output a global attribute to a text file as a function of time.
This can be accomplished simply by calling the :py:func:`export_file` function, which can automatically sample an attribute's value 
and write it to the output file one line per frame:

```python
  pipeline = import_file('input/trajectory.dump')
  pipeline.modifiers.append(ConstructSurfaceModifier(radius = 1.9))
  export_file(pipeline, 'output/surface_area.txt', 
      format='txt/attr',

      multiple_frames=True)

class UnwrapTrajectoriesModifier(ovito.pipeline.Modifier):
    """Base: :py:class:`ovito.pipeline.Modifier`

This modifier determines when particles cross through the periodic boundaries of the simulation cell and unwraps the particle coordinates in order to make the trajectories continuous. As a result of this operation, particle trajectories will no longer fold back into the simulation cell and instead lead outside the cell. 

Note that, to unwrap the particle coordinates, the modifier may have to step through all frames of the input simulation trajectory to detect jumps in the trajectories. This will not be necessary, however, if the ``Periodic Image`` particle property has been loaded from the input simulation file, because then the modifier can directly use this information to unwrap the particle coordinates.

See the corresponding user manual page
for more information on this modifier. Note that this modifier inherits several important parameter fields 
from its :py:class:`StructureIdentificationModifier` base class.

The Voronoi cell of a particle is the region of space closer to it than to any other particle. 
The topology of the Voronoi cell is the manner in which its faces are connected, and describes 
the manner in which a particle's neighbors are arranged.  The topology of a Voronoi cell can be 
completely described in a vector of integers called a *Weinberg vector* 
[`Weinberg, IEEE Trans. Circuit Theory 13:2 (1966) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCT.1966.1082573>`__]. 

This modifier requires loading a *filter*, which specifies structure types and associated 
Weinberg vectors.  Filters for several common structures can be obtained from the 
`VoroTop <https://www.vorotop.org/download.html>`__ website. 
The modifier calculates the Voronoi cell topology of each particle, uses the provided 
filter to determine the structure type, and stores the results in the ``Structure Type`` particle property. 
This allows the user to subsequently select particles  of a certain structural type, e.g. by using the 
:py:class:`SelectTypeModifier`. 

This method is well-suited for analyzing finite-temperature systems, including those heated to 
their bulk melting temperatures. This robust behavior relieves the need to quench a sample 
(such as by energy minimization) prior to analysis. 
Further information about the Voronoi topology approach for local structure analysis, as well 
as additional filters, can be found on the `VoroTop webpage <https://www.vorotop.org/>`__."""
