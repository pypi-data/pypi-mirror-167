=======================================

Create a radio of type "Control Head", and on the Radio/Remote screen enter the IP address of the
remote radio and a password. Change the hardware file to ac2yd/control_softrock.py or
ac2yd/control_hermes.py. Enter the usual widget file if any. Create sound devices for radio sound
and microphone sound. Do not create devices for samples.

Create a radio of the correct type at the remote site. For example, SoftRock USB or Hermes. Set up
the radio to correctly control the hardware. You should be able to operate successfully at the remote.
Then change the hardware file to ac2yd/remote_softrock.py or ac2yd/remote_hermes.py. Enter the usual
widget file if any. Enter the same password on the Radio/Remote screen. The password only needs to be
entered once at each end. It is a "shared secret". Use a somewhat lengthy pass phrase of random words,
at least 20 characters long.

You can use Windows, Mac or Linux at either end. But for Windows, the Windows Firewall will interfere.
Do not turn the firewall off. Change the network profile type from the default Public to Private if
you are on a private home network. The setting is under Settings, Network, WiFi or Ethernet, Network Profile.
If you are on a public network, you should use a VPN for security. 

For security, Quisk will not accept remote operation unless the special hardware files are used. And the
password or pass phrase must match. But you must (as usual) make sure both computers are secure and can not
be broken into. You must (as usual) have a good router password and secure settings to protect your home network.
