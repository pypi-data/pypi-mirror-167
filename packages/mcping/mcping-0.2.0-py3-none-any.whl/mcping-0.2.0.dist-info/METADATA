Get statuses from Minecraft servers.

## Difference between this and mcstatus

This package uses some classes and functions from [mcstatus].

Unlike mcstatus, this package will only attempt to handshake and get the status.
It doesn't do any DNS lookups or pings that aren't strictly required to get the status.

This package also doesn't convert the status response into a series of nested classes,
which should make the results much easier to work with, especially when dealing with
non-standard status responses (eg. Forge mod lists).

A side effect of this is that there isn't any guarantee that the status response
will have all of the keys that it should, meaning you'll need to do some validation
before assuming that keys are present, or that they're the types you think.

## Docs

Documentation is available at <https://mcping.readthedocs.io>.

## Installation

If you want to use the library, install with `pip`:

```sh
pip install mcping
```

If you only want the CLI, `pipx` is recommended:

```sh
pipx install mcping
```

## Use

### Library

```python
import mcping

# Synchronous
mcping.status('127.0.0.1')

# Asynchronous
async def main():
    await mcping.async_status('127.0.0.1')
```

### CLI

The package also includes a CLI to get server statuses.
It can be run from a cloned repo using the `cli.py` file:

```sh
python3 cli.py example.com
python3 cli.py example.com:25565
```

If the library is installed, the `mcping` script should also be installed and available globally:

```sh
mcping example.com
mcping example.com:25565
```
