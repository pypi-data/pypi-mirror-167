# Dynamic Time Warping 

This package allows to measure the similarity between two-time sequences, i.e., it finds the optimal alignment between two time-dependent sequences. It will enable the calculation of univariate and multivariate time series. Any distance available in `scipy.spatial.distance` and `gower` distance can be used. Extra functionality has been incorporated to transform the resulting DTW matrix into an exponential kernel.

Common functionalities for 2-time series (TS):
- It incorporates the possibility of visualizing the cost matrix and the path to reach the DTW distance value between two TS. This will allow its use in a didactic way, providing a better understanding of the method used.
- It is possible to calculate TS with the same and different lengths. 

Common functionalities for N (> 2) time series (TS):
- The calculation can be parallelized by the CPU by selecting the number of threads. As a result, we will obtain the distance matrix. 
- It is possible to perform not only the calculation of distances but also similarities (based on an exponential kernel).

Multivariate TS functionalities: 
- Calculation of dependent DTW and independent DTW is available.

## Installation

dtwParallel can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), a tool
for installing Python packages. To do it, run the following command:
```
pip install dtwParallel
```

## Requirements

dtwParallel requires Python >= 3.6.1 or later to run. For other Python
dependencies, please check the `pyproject.toml` file included
on this repository.


Note that you should have also the following packages installed in your system:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- gower
- setuptools
- scipy
- joblib


## Usage

Based on the previous scheme, this package can be used in three different contexts: 

### 1) Calculation of the DTW distance with input from the terminal.
   
   The generic example is shown below:
      
      dtwParallel -x <floats> -y <floats> -d <str> -ce <bool> -of <bool>
      
   Note that only the x and y values need to be set. If not indicated, the rest of the values will be selected from the file containing the default values, ``configuration.ini``.

   Next, different uses are shown by modifying the parameters of the function:
   
   **a) Example 1.** Considers the Euclidean distance, activates the option -ce to check for errors, and uses as input two UTS (denoted as $x$ and $y$) with the same length ($T=10$). 
   Firstly, the input TS and distance are checked as valid entries. Secondly, the \texttt{dtwParallel} package computes the DTW distance. Thirdly, the output is shown in the terminal (while in most cases, the outputs are forwarded to a file, we selected this option to facilitate exposition).
   
   ```
   dtwParallel -x 2 4 6 8 5 3 6 8 9 15 -y 12 0 0 3 5 6 30 1 2 4 -ce True

   ```
   ```
   [out]: 65,0
   ```

   **b) Example 2.** Considering the CityBlock distance.
   
   ```
   dtwParallel -x 2.5 4.3 6.6 8.0 1 0 0 1 5.5 15.2  -y 12.1 0 0 1 1 6.4 3.5 1 0 0  -d cityblock
   ```
   ```
   [out]: 45,4
   ```

   **c) Example 3.** This examples are , respectively, counterparts to **Example 1** and **Example 2**.
   
   ```
   dtwParallel -x 2 4 6 8 5 3 -y 12 0 0 3 5 6 30 1 2 4 
   ```
   ```
   [out]: 44,0
   ```   
   ```
   dtwParallel -x 2.5 4.3 6.6 8.0 1 0 0 1 5.5 15.2 -y 1 0 0 1 -d cityblock
   ```
   ```
   [out]: 36,1
   ```   

   **Remarks:**
   The calculation of the DTW distance from the command line is limited to simple examples that allow a quick understanding due to the complexity of the terminal handling:
   - Univariate time series.
   - Dependent DTW.
   - To visualize the cost matrix and the routing, it will be necessary to use an integrated development environment.

### 2) Calculation of the DTW distance with input from a file, haciendo uso de terminal.


   #### The generic example of univariate time series entered by means of ``csv files`` is shown below:
   ```
   dtwParallel <file_X> -d <str> -ce <bool> -of <bool>
   ```
   If you want to modify any of the possible values, it is necessary to modify the configuration.ini file. The possible values are those shown in [Configuration](#item1).
   
   **a) Example 1.** Calculation of univariate time series taking as input a csv file containing x and y. 

   ```
   dtwParallel exampleData/Data/E1_SyntheticData/example_1.csv

   ```
   ```

   ```
      
   #### The generic example of multivariate time series entered by means of ``csv files`` is shown below:

   ```
   dtwParallel <file_X> -d <str> -t <str> -ce <bool> -of <bool> -n <int> -k <bool> -s <float>
   ```

   **b) Example 2.** Multivariate time series computation using a csv file containing x and y as input.

## Examples with public data

I have used data from yahoo finance (https://finance.yahoo.com/) of 505 companies, available in a .zip file. The folder where the data is located is exampleData/Data/E2_FinanceData (https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/dtwParallel/tree/main/exampleData/Data/E2_FinanceData). The code needed to process the information of each of the 505 companies, obtaining the tensor input to the package is located in exampleData/CodeExamples/E2_FinanceData/tensorGenerator (https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/dtwParallel/tree/main/exampleData/CodeExamples/E2_FinanceData).

### Experiment 1. Computational time as a function of the number of threads. 
The computation of the distance matrix has been carried out using dependent and independent DTW varying the number of threads. Code of this example is available at exampleData/Code/E2_FinanceData (https://github.com/oscarescuderoarnanz/dtwParallel/tree/main/exampleData/CodeExamples/E2_FinanceData).
