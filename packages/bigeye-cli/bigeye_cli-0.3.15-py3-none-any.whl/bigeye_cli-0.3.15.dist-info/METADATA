# **Bigeye CLI**
Version: 0.3.15

## Install
Bigeye CLI is a pip installable package.  Run the following:
```console
pip3 install bigeye-cli
```
## Credential
Run the following command to get logged into your Bigeye workspace from the CLI:

```console
bigeye credential
```

There are two ways to authenticate: basic authentication and browser authentication.

### Basic Authentication
If you select basic authentication, the CLI will prompt you to enter your Bigeye username and password. This will
create a default credential file at ~/.bigeye/default_cred.json. This credential will be used for all CLI commands
calls unless an environment variable is explicitly provided.

```yaml
base_url: "https://app.bigeye.com",
user: "some_user+some_company@bigeye.com",
password: "fakepassword1234"
```

You can create an environment variable for your workspace credential file, this is helpful if you are managing
multiple workspaces and need to flip between them. Add the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc file:

```shell
export BIGEYE_API_CRED_FILE=/some/path/to/bigeye_cred_file.json
```

Lastly, if you want to specify the credential per command, you can always pass a -b parameter with the file path for
the desired credential.

### Browser Authentication
Alternatively, you can use browser authentication. Login to your bigeye workspace on a Chrome, Chromium or
Firefox browser. Run **bigeye credential** and select browser_auth when prompted in the CLI and follow the
instructions. If you use Chrome profiles, make sure to specify the profile email address you are logged into.

Note: your authentication will only be valid so long as your browser session is active.

## Basic Usage
```console
$ bigeye --help
```
## Tab/Auto Completion
Bigeye supports tab/auto completion for many different shells.  For example, run:
```console
$ bigeye --install-completion zsh
```
### ZSH Completion
Verify that the following has been added to your shell rc file:
```shell
autoload -Uz compinit
zstyle :completion:* menu select
fpath+=~/.zfunc
```
If you are having trouble with auto complete then add the following below the 3 lines above.
```shell
compinit
```
