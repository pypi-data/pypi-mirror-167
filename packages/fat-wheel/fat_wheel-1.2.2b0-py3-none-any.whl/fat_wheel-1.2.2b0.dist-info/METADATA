=========
Fat Wheel
=========

Fat Wheel are basically wheels which include dependencies inside whl/tar/egg distribution
similar in java we build a fat jar and run app from jar which have deps in inside the jar
Fat Wheel try to solve to problems.

1. you just build the fat-wheel and install and run it
2. as dist have same deps inside when built and same deps install on use site
3. share code and install deps when have no internet connection(which is not a problem today ;-))


Usage
*****

1. install fat-wheel

.. code-block:: text

    pip install fat-wheel

2. run ``fatwheel`` in cmd and run it project root dir and press enter

::

    fatwheel

3. it will generate a local copy of project with deps and build whl/sdist/egg dist
4. use whl/tar/egg dist and install
5. it will install and create a cli command, command name is same as root_pkg name

not supported yet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. currently only support flat-layout means root pkg in project root dir

::

    project-root-dir
     |
     |--pkg
     |   |--__init__.py
     |   |....
     |....



2. not include package data and datafiles(no sync with project setup.py)
