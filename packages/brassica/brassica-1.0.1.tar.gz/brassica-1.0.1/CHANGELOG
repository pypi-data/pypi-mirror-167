Version 1.0.1 (2022-09-13)

  * IF - THEN statements allow an optional ELSE clause.
  * RND(X) returns a new variate for any X > 0 (no longer insists X = 1).
  * RND(X) seeds the pseudorandom number generator with INT(X) when X < 0.
  * MOD and \ operators implemented (from extended Altair BASIC, 1975).
  * DATA and REM statements are checked at load time (for not_run() purposes).
  * Bug fix: a typo caused some fatal BASIC errors to trigger Python errors.
  * Tweaked life.bas to prompt for continuation at generations 20 and 50.
  * Added animal.bas and hammurabi.bas to the bundled listings.
  * BASIC manual (README.md) updated.
