# TUW-NLP

NLP utilities developed at TUW informatics. 

## Install and Quick Start
Install the tuw-nlp repository from pip:

```
pip install tuw-nlp
```

Or install from source:
```
pip install -e .
```

On Windows and Mac, you might also need to install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) manually.

You will also need some additional steps to use the library:

Download nltk stopwords:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

Download stanza models for UD parsing:

```python
import stanza

stanza.download("en")
stanza.download("de")
```

And then finally download ALTO and tuw_nlp dictionaries:
```python
import tuw_nlp

tuw_nlp.download_alto()
tuw_nlp.download_definitions()
```

__Also please make sure to have JAVA on your system to be able to use the parser!__

Then you can parse a sentence as simple as:

```python
from tuw_nlp.grammar.text_to_4lang import TextTo4lang

tfl = TextTo4lang("en", "en_nlp_cache")

fl_graphs = list(tfl("brown dog", depth=1, substitute=False))

# Then the fl_graphs will directly contain a networkx graph object
fl_graphs[0].nodes(data=True)

```
For more examples you can check the jupyter notebook under *notebooks/experiment*

## Services

We also provide services built on our package. To get to know more visit [services](services).

### Text_to_4lang service

To run a browser-based demo (also available [online](https://ir-group.ec.tuwien.ac.at/fourlang)) for building graphs from raw texts, first start the graph building service:

```
python services/text_to_4lang/backend/service.py
```

Then run the frontend with this command:

```
streamlit run services/text_to_4lang/frontend/demo.py
```

In the demo you can parse english and german sentences and you can also try out multiple algorithms our graphs implement, such as `expand`, `substitute` and `append_zero_paths`.
