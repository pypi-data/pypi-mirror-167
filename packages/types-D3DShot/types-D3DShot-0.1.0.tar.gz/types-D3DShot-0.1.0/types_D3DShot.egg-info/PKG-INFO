## Typing stubs for D3DShot

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `D3DShot` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `D3DShot`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/D3DShot. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `3ec7b1f2bb5fb87314623c6237b1ea508d98c0a6`.
