        :alt: Documentation Status

Run a python script or function only once in a given time frame.

If, for example, you have a script or service which might be called frequently,
but you want to report errors only once daily to not annoy people too much,
`once_only` is the library for you.

Quickstart
----------

Suppose you want your script to complain, but not more than once a day.
``once_only.daily`` is the tool you need::

    import once_only

    @once_only.daily
    def complain():
        print("This is not right!")

Now you can run ``complain`` as often as you want, from the same python
script or from others, it will only be run at
most once a day, so that at least 24 hours are between two complaints.

If you want to complain more or less often, there are other variants:

======================  ==========
object                  time delta
======================  ==========
``once_only.weekly``    1 week
``once_only.daily``     1 day
``once_only.hourly``    1 hour
``once_only.minutely``  1 minute
``once_only.Once()``    custom ``datetime.timedelta``
======================  ==========

Advanced Usage
--------------

Instead of using a ``once_only.Once`` object as a decorator, you can also access
it directly via the ``check_ready()`` and
``check_ready_trigger()`` functions::

    import once_only
    import datetime

    once_every_two_hours = once_only.Once(datetime.timedelta(hours=2))

    if once_every_two_hours.check_ready():
        print("More than two hours have passed since last run!")

    if not_a_dry_run and once_every_two_hours.check_ready_trigger():
        print("Triggering timer and running!")

Note that all instances of ``once_only.Once`` with the same time delta share the
same timer, but those with different time deltas don't share the timer.
So, if you have never run anything before, this::

    import once_only
    import datetime

    @once_only.minutely
    def run_minutely():
        print("minutely")

    @once_only.hourly
    def run_hourly():
        print("hourly")

    @once_only.Once(datetime.timedelta(minutes=60))
    def run_every_60_minutes():
        print("60 minutes")

    run_minutely()
    run_hourly()
    run_every_60_minutes()

will print "minutely" and "hourly", but not "60 minutes" because
60 minutes is the same as one hour, so the 60 minutes timer will
already be triggered by ``run_hourly`` and ``run_every_60_minutes`` will not be
run.
