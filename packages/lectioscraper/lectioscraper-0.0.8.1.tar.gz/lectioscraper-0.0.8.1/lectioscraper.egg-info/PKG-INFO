        # LectioScraper
        
        LectioScraper is a python package for helping you scrape lectio.dk with ease. It uses requests for the actual scraping and beautifulsoup for parsing the html. Scraping lectio.dk can be a tedious task, as it requires so much different html elements to be parsed. and lectio is a big website so there are a lot of different pages to scrape. Here you have everything configured and all you need to do is to import lectioscraper and start scraping (see the whole documentation below).
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install lectioscraper.
        
        ```bash
        pip install lectioscraper
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import lectioscraper
        
        # Initializes the class
        client = lectioscraper.Lectio("username", "password", "schoolId")
