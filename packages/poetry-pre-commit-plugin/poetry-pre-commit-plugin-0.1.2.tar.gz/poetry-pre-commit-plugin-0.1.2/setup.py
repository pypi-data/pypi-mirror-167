    'long_description': "# Poetry pre-commit Plugin\n\nA [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) plugin for automatically installing git\npre-commit hooks whenever `pre-commit` is specified as a dependency of the\nproject.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPersonally I find that running `pre-commit install` every time I start working\non a new repository is very easy to forget - there have been numerous occasions\nwhere I'd forget this step, commit some changes only to be surprised later on\nby failing CI checks 😅 This plugin aims to solve this issue by doing\nthis small step for me automatically behind the scenes.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe plugin requires Poetry version `1.2.0b1` or above. Since this is still a\npre-release version, you have to specify it explicitly when installing:\n\n```\ncurl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3.9 - --version 1.2.0b3\n```\n\nOnce a valid version of Poetry is set up, you can install the plugin like so:\n\n```\npoetry self add poetry-pre-commit-plugin\n```\n\nFor more in-depth information, please refer to\n[Poetry's docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/plugins/).\n\n## Usage\n\nThere's no way to use this plugin explicitly - it will work behind the scenes\nafter you run either `poetry install` or `poetry add`. In either of those cases,\nthe plugin will check the following conditions:\n\n1. Is the project inside a git repository?\n2. Is `pre-commit` listed as a dependency of the project (or, in the case of\n   `poetry add` - was it just added)?\n3. Has the pre-commit hook **not** been activated yet (i.e. the file\n   `.git/hooks/pre-commit` does not exist)?\n\nIf all conditions are met, the plugin will run `pre-commit install` for you.\n",
