Description: ====================
        Reporting API Client
        ====================
        
        This is a Python Client for `Jampp's Reporting API`_. For more information, check the `docs`.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Execute Pivots in an user friendly manner.
        * Execute raw GraphQL queries against the Reporting API.
        
        
        Basic Usage
        ===========
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import os
        
            from reporting_api_client import ReportingAPIClient
        
        
            client = ReportingAPIClient(os.environ["CLIENT_ID"], os.environ["CLIENT_SECRET"])
            query = """{
                pivot(from: "2022-07-01", to: "2022-07-02", granularity: DAILY) {
                    results {
                        clicks
                    }
                }
            }"""
        
            result = client.query(query)
            print(result)
        
        
        Executing the above code should output a result similar to the following:
        
          .. code-block:: console
        
              $ python example.py
              {'pivot': {'results': [{'clicks': 123456}]}}
