## Summary

General knowledge fallback handler based on [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com) services

## Description

Answers general knowledge, math, and definition questions by using Wolfram Alpha Api services. If the user is interested in knowing where the information for the spoken answer came from, Neon can send the most recent source of the spoken details to userâ€™s email.
Responses are cached and saved for later use.

Use of this skill requires use of third-party APIs. If you do not have access to Neon API servers, you may access the
Wolfram|Alpha API directly by providing a key in `~/wolfram.txt`. You can generate a Wolfram|Alpha key
[here](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps/).

## Examples

Ask Neon any questions starting with `What`, `Why`, or `How`
- What is 2 + 2
- Who won best picture in 2006
- How far away is the moon

To receive an email with related information:
- Send me the source for that

> **Please note that Neon will ask for your email address and name if this information is not currently available in your user settings.**
