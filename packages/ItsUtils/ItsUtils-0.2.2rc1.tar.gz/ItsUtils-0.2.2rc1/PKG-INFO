## Features

These are the currently available features:

### StringMath

```py
from its_utils.string_math import StringMath

print(StringMath.full('1*10^45*(3+5)'))
```

This utility calculates the result of a stringified mathematical expression and returns the result as an integer.

It uses the Shunting-Yard algorithm and follows the correct order of operation rules.

### WordMath

```py
from its_utils.word_math import WordMath

print(WordMath.full('siebentausendvierhundertunddreiundachtzig'))
```

This utility returns the integer expression of a numeral.

Currently, it only works for the german language, but i may be later extended to support other languages too.

It works with numbers up to `999,999,999 (neunhundertneunundneunzig millionen neunhundertneunundneunzigtausendneunhundertundneunundneunzig)`, but may be later extend to even bigger numbers.

### DebugPrompt

```py
from its_utils.debug_prompt import Input

inp = Input.input("Type your name: ", 5)
```

This utility can get an input from the user for a given number of seconds. If no input was given after these seconds, it timeouts and returns None.
