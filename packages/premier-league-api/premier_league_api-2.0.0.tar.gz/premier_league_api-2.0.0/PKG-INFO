Description: # Premier League API
        
        [![Python Checking](https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/preimer_league_api/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Cyb3r-Jak3/preimer_league_api/actions/workflows/lint.yml) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/preimer-league-api/badge/?version=latest)](https://premier-league.docs.jwhite.network/en/latest/?badge=latest) ![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/premier-league-api) ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/premier-league-api)
        
        An **unofficial** api client for pulling player and fixture data from the [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/)
        
        It would seem that the API backend is suited to support more leagues as well as manager so there could be future work to expand there.
        
        There are a ton of stats that you can get for players. Read the [documentation](https://premier-league.docs.jwhite.network/en/latest/) to get started
        
        
        ### Goals
        
        * Other leagues
        * Use as a library rather than client
        * Manager stats
