# MMI Custodian SDK

A Python library to create and submit EVM transactions to custodians connected with MetaMask Institutional.

## Usage

For documentation on how to use the library, please visit the page [MetaMask Institutional SDK](https://consensys.gitlab.io/codefi/products/mmi/mmi-sdk-py/sdk-python/), or visit the [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/ConsenSys/codefi/products/mmi/mmi-sdk-py/-/blob/main/docs/mkdocs/sdk-python.md).

You can also explore various usage examples in the directory [`./examples`](https://gitlab.com/ConsenSys/codefi/products/mmi/mmi-sdk-py/-/tree/main/examples).

### TL;DR:

```bash
pip3 install mmisdk
```

```python
from mmisdk.custodian_factory import CustodianFactory

factory = CustodianFactory()

custodian = factory.create_for("qredo", "YOUR-REFRESH-TOKEN")

transaction = custodian.create_transaction(qredo_tx_details, tx_params)
custodian.get_transaction(transaction.id)
```

## Developer documentation

ðŸš¨ The commands we list below use `python` and `pip`. Depending on your local setup, you might need to replace them by `python3` and `pip3`.

### Requirements

-   Python 3.7 or above

### Installing dependencies

To install `mmisdk`, along with the tools you need to develop and run tests, run the following:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Unit tests

Run all unit tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

### Releasing the library

Before releasing your package on PyPI you should have all the tox environments passing.

#### Version management

This template provides a basic [bumpversion](https://pypi.org/project/bump2version) configuration. It's as simple as running:

-   `bumpversion patch` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`.
-   `bumpversion minor` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `1.1.0`.
-   `bumpversion major` to increase version from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`.

Use [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/) standard to bump versions.

#### Building the library

Before building dists make sure you got a clean build area:

```bash
rm -rf build
rm -rf src/*.egg-info
```

Note:

> Dirty `build` or `egg-info` dirs can cause problems: missing or stale files in the resulting dist or strange and confusing errors. Avoid having them around.

Then you should check that you got no packaging issues:

```bash
tox -e check
```

When checking with `tox -e check`, you might receive warnings from `isort` that imports are not properly ordered. To automatically sort your imports with `isort`, run the following:

```bash
pip install isort
isort .
```

To run a complete QA analysis, including unit tests again multiple Python versions, manifest check, and imports order check, run:

```bash
tox
```

And then you can build the `sdist`, and if possible, the `bdist_wheel` too:

```bash
python setup.py clean --all sdist bdist_wheel
```

#### Publishing to PyPI

To make a release of the project on PyPI, assuming you got some distributions in `dist/`, the most simple usage is:

```bash
twine upload --skip-existing dist/*.whl dist/*.gz dist/*.zip
```

In ZSH you can use this to upload everything in `dist/` that ain't a linux-specific wheel (you may need `setopt extended_glob`):

```bash
twine upload --skip-existing dist/*.(whl|gz|zip)~dist/*linux*.whl
```
