# py-epg

**py-epg** is an easy to use, modular, multi-process EPG grabber written in Python.

* üì∫ Scrapes various TV Program websites and saves programs in XMLTV format.
* üß© Simply extend [EpgScraper](https://github.com/szab100/py_epg/blob/main/py_epg/common/epg_scraper.py) to grab EPG from your favorite TV site (requires basic Python skills).
* ü§ñ The framework provides the rest:
    * [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc) - easily search & extract data from html elements 
    * multi-processing
    * config management
    * logging
    * build & write XMLTV (with auto-generated fields, eg 'stop')
    * proxy server support
    * auto http/s retries
    * random fake user_agents
* üöÄ Save time by fetching channels in parallel (caution: use proxy server(s) to avoid getting blacklisted)!
* üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Your contributions are welcome! Feel free to create a PR with your tv-site scraper and/or framework improvements.
