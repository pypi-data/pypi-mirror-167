# gettex - gettext tools for usage with LaTeX

[TOC]

## Overview

The GNU toolset [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) is a popular and widely used
system for application translations.
It does however not support [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org), an strangely even more
widely used typesetting language.

This tool provides drop-ins for the tools `xgettext` (to extract message ids from the source text
into a .pot file) and `msgfmt` (to distill the translated .po files into a format that can be
used in the source).

### Similar projects

A similar project is [tex-gettext](https://github.com/mplucinski/tex-gettext), but with these
noteworthy difference of how the translations go into the document:
In tex-gettext, the source tex document and the translated .po files are merged into a new
tex document in which function calls to gettext are replaced with the translated text.

Instead this repository creates a tex library (`.sty`) file, which needs to be imported by
the source document, which stays otherwise unchanged.

### gettext complication: plural handling

A common challenge in software applications is to translate messages dependent on a number
which need to adapt to the plural rules of different languages.

I would expect (and it is true for my use case) that a tex document is a rather fixed affair
and does not require pluralizable messages, but tex is after all a kind of programming
language, so this issue needs to be solved.

When creating a `.po` file via the `msginit` tool from gettext, it will automatically add
a plural specification into the file.  In order to fetch the correct plural form, the
library must be able to calculate (using tex) the result of a mathmatical formula, which
is defined in the po.

The author of tex-gettext, Mariusz Pluciński, created a wonderful parser and tex-generator.
Instead of using that, however, I changed the logic to produce more concise tex code and
added a static mapping from all known plural specs into tex code.
This little tool will thus fail, if the spec is unknown, i.e. even if there is only a
braketing difference.

As I don't expect new plural forms to evolve, I suggest you change the unknown spec to a
known one (see [sty_renderer.py](src/gettex/sty_renderer.py)).

## Usage

### Add gettext function calls into the tex code

Surround each message text that should be translated with one of these functions:

* `gettext[optional comment]{message}`
* `pgettext[optional comment]{context}{message}`
* `ngettext[optional comment]{message}{plural message}{\integerVariable}`
* `pngettext[oc]{context}{message}{plural}{\integerVariable}`

A comment can be a help text for the translator, which has no effect on the translation.

The context is similarly a help text for the translator, but has the effect of generating
a different message id, even if the message is the same.

Even though it's not necessary yet, you should also add an include statement for the `gettext.sty`.
Example:

```tex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
\usepackage{gettext}
\usepackage{sectsty}                   

\newcommand{\sacerdos}[1]{%
\gettext{Sacerdos}: #1\\
  \renewcommand{\sacerdos}[1]{\pgettext{Sacerdos}{S}: ##1\\}
}
\newcommand{\populo}[1]{%
\textbf{\gettext{Populo}: #1}\\
  \renewcommand{\populo}[1]{\textbf{\pgettext{Populo}{P}: ##1}\\}
}

\begin{document}

\section*{\gettext{Ritus initiales}}
\subsection*{\gettext{Salutatio}}
\sacerdos{\gettext{In nómine patris, et Fílii, et Spíritus Sancti.}}
\populo{\gettext{Amen.}}
\sacerdos{\gettext{Dóminus vobíscum.}}
\populo{\gettext{Et cum spíritu tuo.}}

\end{document}                      
```

### Call xgettext to extract the messages

Install this tool and call xgettext on your input tex file:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
[venv]$ pip install gettex
[venv]$ xgettext ordo.tex
Wrote 10 messages and the header to messages.po
```

This will create the messages.po file.
At least this is the default behaviour of gettext's xgettext.
I suggest you rename it to `messages.pot`, because it is the basis for all translation files
and will be overwritten by future calls to xgettext.

I do try to keep the header comments intact though.
So you should take some time to edit this file to add a descriptive title and a package version.
These variables can also be set via `xgettext` cli parameters.

### Create .po files for languages

Let's jump straight into the commands:

```bash
domain=messages
for lang in en_US de_DE pl; do
  langfile="locale/${domain}-${lang}.po"
  if ! test -f "$langfile"; then
    msginit -i "$domain.pot" -l $lang -o "$langfile"
  else
    msgmerge "$langfile" "$domain.pot"
  fi
done
```

This is just normal gettext stuff, not using this here project at all.
But now you have `.po` files for each wanted language.

Edit those and add the translations.

### Format the translations as tex library

Assuming you have the above virtual environment with the installed gettex package:

```bash
[venv]$ msgfmt locale/messages-en_US.po -o gettext.sty
```

This will create a file `gettext.sty`, which you can now use with the document:

```bash
$ pdflatex ordo.tex
This is pdfTeX, ...
(/usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/inputenc.sty) (./gettext.sty
...
Output written on ordo.pdf (1 page, 25212 bytes).
Transcript written on ordo.log.
```

## Open issues

* textdomains
  * Normally it should be possible from the code to select the catalog with the `bindtextdomain` function, or with an additional parameter in the `d*gettext` functions.
  * Multiple catalogs can be active at the same time
* language selection
  * similarly the language should be selectable in the code with `setlocale`.  Currently the language is determined by which language was used to generate the `.sty`.

# Changelog

* Version 1.0
  * Initial published version with some known flaws.
