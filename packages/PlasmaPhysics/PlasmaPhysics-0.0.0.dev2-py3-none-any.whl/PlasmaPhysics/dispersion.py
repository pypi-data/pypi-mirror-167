# factory function that returns a generalized plasma dispersion function based on the complex Hilbert transform of the fourier sampled distribution function; see Weideman's Computation of the Complex Error Function where we generalize to non-Maxwellian integrands. Note, this is also what Xie's paper does, but that paper is complete garbage and hard to follow. It was easier to just rederive the results of the paper from Weideman.
