# Description

This package comprises various algorithms for solving the Active Time Problem developed to this date. The following
table provides a list of the implemented algorithms available in the subpackage `schedulers` and the corresponding
articles where these algorithms were developed.

# Usage Examples

To create a job set, the subclasses of `AbstractJobPool` from the subpackage `models` are used. Different subclasses can be
to represent different properties for the jobs in them, for example `FixedLengthJobPool` demands a fixed length from its
jobs. The following example demonstrates the process of creating a job pool and adding a job to it:

```python
from models import JobPool

job_pool = JobPool()
job_pool.add_job(release_time=5, deadline=8, duration=2)
```

To process the job pool, the subclasses of `AbstractScheduler` from the subpackage `schedulers` are used. To perform the
processing, the job pool should be passed into the `process` function. The result of the function is the computed job
schedule, which, if the problem instance is feasible, contains the information regarding the active time slots as well as
individual schedules:

```python
from schedulers import FlowMethod, GreedyScheduler

scheduler = GreedyScheduler(FlowMethod.PREFLOW_PUSH)
schedule = scheduler.process(job_pool, max_concurrency=2)
```
