# cbpi4-SimulatedSensor
this simulated sensor will have a value dependent of a kettle. the value will increase by a configurable amount if the kettle is currently heating and if the kettle is not heating the value will decrease by a configurable amount. This Plugin should be used very carefully and before actually connection a real heater the simulated sensor should be removed out of the hardware config. If you accidentally act on the simulated sensor you can only blame yourself. I use this to try and test specific functions in plugin development. This simulated sensor should never be used in a production environment.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
