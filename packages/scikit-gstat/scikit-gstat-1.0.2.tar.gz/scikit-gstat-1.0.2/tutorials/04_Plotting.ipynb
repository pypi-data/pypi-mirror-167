    "At the core of SciKit-GStat is a set of classes, that can be used interactively to perform variogram analysis. One important aspect of this analysis is a rich collection of plotting functions. These are directly available as class methods of the `Variogram`, `DirectionalVariogram` and `SpaceTimeVariogram` method.\n",
    "With version `0.3.3`, SciKit-GStat implements two different plotting backend: [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/). Generally speaking, matplotlib is great for creating publication ready figures in a variety of formats, including vector-graphic PDF files. Plotly, on the other hand, will translate the figure into their Javascript library and open a webbrowser with an interactive plot. This way you can obtain the same figure either for your publication as PDF, or as a HTML object that can be injected into a project report website.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the newly introduced `skgstat.plotting` backend, you can easily read and change the backend with a single convenient function. The default backend is `'matplotlib'`. Please be aware, that `plotly` is only a soft dependency, meaning you need to take care of the installation yourself, to keep SciKit-GStat's dependency list shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used to create the `Variogram` and `DirectionalVariogram` is from Mälicke (2021). Here, pancake dataset is used.\n",
    "The spatio-temporal data is derived from Fersch et al. (2020). From that data publication, the wireless sensor network data is used. The originaly published 15 minutes intervals soil temperature data at 20 cm depth was taken for all 55 stations and aggregated to mean hourly values. To further decrease the data size, only every 6th data point is used here. Estimating the full data set will take approx. 120GB RAM and processing took about 30 minutes. The results for the thinned data sample are very comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both data samples can either be obtained by the orignial publications, or from the SciKit-GStat documentation. Both samples are published under Creative Commons BY 4.0 license. Please cite the original publications if you use the data, and **not** SciKit-GStat.\n",
