<br>

## Overview
The current Watchful features include the following:

## Steps

### Create Python Enviroment
Create a Python virtual environment and activate it. The following are a few ways to do it:
- https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html
- https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
- https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Assuming you chose _Conda_, follow these steps to set up the environment:
```
conda create --name=watchful_py python=3.8.12
```
```
conda activate watchful_py
```
<br>

### Install Watchful Package
Install the built package. Add `--force-reinstall` to guarantee a (re)installation if you had installed Watchful previously.
```
pip3 install watchful[==your.desired.version] [--force-reinstall]
```
Show the installed Watchful package.
```
pip3 list | grep 'Package\|watchful'
```
<br>

### Run Tests
After you've done the preceding steps correctly, you will be able to see the following:
```
python3 -c 'import watchful; print(watchful.__version__);'
```
The version for Watchful Package is printed on screen.
