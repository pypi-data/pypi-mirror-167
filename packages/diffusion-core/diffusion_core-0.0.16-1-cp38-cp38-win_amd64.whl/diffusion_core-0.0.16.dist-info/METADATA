# Python SDK for Diffusion - Core functionality

**Pre-release version; not ready for production.**

This is the core module for the [Python SDK for Diffusion](https://pypi.org/project/diffusion/).
It provides core functionality for the Python client, in particular
the native bindings for various performance-critical functions.

## Supported Python Versions

The Diffusion Python SDK officially supports the following:

Supported Interpreters:

* CPython 3.7.9 or later
* CPython 3.8.6 or later
* CPython 3.9.0 or later

Supported Platforms:

* MacOS 10.13-11.5
* Windows Intel 64-bit
* Any Linux supported by the [ManyLinux 2010/2014](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) binary wheel standard.

## Current Capabilities

- CBOR (the binary protocol used to communicate with the Diffusion Server):
  - indefinite encoding (the preferred variant)
  - definite encoding
- Delta encoding/decoding (used to send and receive changes in a compact, CBOR-based format)

## Test call

```
python
import diffusion_cbor
obj = {"arbitary":["json", "data", 0.0, -35]}
diffusion_cbor.dumps(obj, indefinite=True)
```
