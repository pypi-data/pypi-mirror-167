        Parameters
        --------------------------
        embedding_size: int = 100
            Dimension of the embedding.
        alpha: float = 0.75
            Alpha parameter for GloVe's loss.
        epochs: int = 100
            Number of epochs to train the model for.
        window_size: int = 10
            Window size for the local context.
            On the borders the window size is trimmed.
        clipping_value: float = 6.0
            Value at which we clip the dot product, mostly for numerical stability issues.
            By default, `6.0`, where the loss is already close to zero.
        walk_length: int = 128
            Maximal length of the walks.
        iterations: int = 10
            Number of iterations of the single walks.
        window_size: int = 5
            Window size for the local context.
            On the borders the window size is trimmed.
        max_neighbours: Optional[int] = 100
            Number of maximum neighbours to consider when using approximated walks.
            By default, None, we execute exact random walks.
            This is mainly useful for graphs containing nodes with high degrees.
        learning_rate: float = 0.001
            The learning rate to use to train the DeepWalk model. By default 0.01.
        central_nodes_embedding_path: Optional[str] = None
            Path where to mmap and store the central nodes embedding.
            This is necessary to embed large graphs whose embedding will not
            fit into the available main memory.
        contextual_nodes_embedding_path: Optional[str] = None
            Path where to mmap and store the central nodes embedding.
            This is necessary to embed large graphs whose embedding will not
            fit into the available main memory.
        learning_rate_decay: float = 0.9
            Factor to reduce the learning rate for at each epoch. By default 0.9.
        normalize_by_degree: bool = False
            Whether to normalize the random walk by the node degree
            of the destination node degrees.
        dtype: str = "f32"
            The data type to be employed, by default f32.
        random_state: int = 42
            The random state to reproduce the training sequence.
        enable_cache: bool = False
            Whether to enable the cache, that is to
            store the computed embedding.
