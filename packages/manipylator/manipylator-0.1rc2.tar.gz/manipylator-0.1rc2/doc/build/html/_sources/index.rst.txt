Welcome to manipylator's documentation!
=======================================

**Manipylator** is Python-based controller used to run a motorized manipulator through a user-friendly graphical interface. 
This package offers several mechanical assays to physically manipulate a sample.  
In particular, **Manipylator** provides in real time controller to exert controlled forces through a cantilever-based force sensor and actuator. 

**Manipylator** currently supports PI ([Physik Instrumente](https://www.physikinstrumente.com/en/)) motorized stages to drive the manipulator.
