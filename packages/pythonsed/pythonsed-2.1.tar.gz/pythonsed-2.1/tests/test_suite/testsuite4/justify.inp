It gets a text already wrapped on the desired number of columns
and add extra white spaces, from left to right, word by word,
to justify all the lines. There is a maximum of 5 spaces to 
be inserted between the words. If this limit is reached, the line
is not justified (come on, more than 5 is horrible). Empty
lines are ignored. BTW, this comments were justified with 
this script &:)
