        server. This may include any security context information.


        id: The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once
            assigned, this value never changes.

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the resource. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and
            use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension,
            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        meta: The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the
            infrastructure. Changes to the content may not always be associated with
            version changes to the resource.

        implicitRules: A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was
            constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content.

        language: The base language in which the resource is written.

        text: A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource, and may be
            used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need
            not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient
            detail to make it "clinically safe" for a human to just read the narrative.
            Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the
            narrative to ensure clinical safety.

        contained: These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource
            that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they
            have their own independent transaction scope.

        resourceType: This is a Endpoint resource

        identifier: Identifier for the organization that is used to identify the endpoint across
            multiple disparate systems.

        status: active | suspended | error | off | test.

        connectionType: A coded value that represents the technical details of the usage of this
            endpoint, such as what WSDLs should be used in what way. (e.g.
            XDS.b/DICOM/cds-hook).

        name: A friendly name that this endpoint can be referred to with.

        managingOrganization: The organization that manages this endpoint (even if technically another
            organisation is hosting this in the cloud, it is the organisation associated
            with the data).

        contact: Contact details for a human to contact about the subscription. The primary use
            of this for system administrator troubleshooting.

        period: The interval during which the endpoint is expected to be operational.

        payloadType: The payload type describes the acceptable content that can be communicated on
            the endpoint.

        payloadMimeType: The mime type to send the payload in - e.g. application/fhir+xml,
            application/fhir+json. If the mime type is not specified, then the sender
            could send any content (including no content depending on the connectionType).

        address: The uri that describes the actual end-point to connect to.

        header: Additional headers / information to send as part of the notification.
