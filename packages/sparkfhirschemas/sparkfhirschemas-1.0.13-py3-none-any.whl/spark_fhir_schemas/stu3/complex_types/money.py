        id: unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This

        extension: May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic
            definition of the element. In order to make the use of extensions safe and
            manageable, there is a strict set of governance  applied to the definition and

            there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of
            the extension.

        value: The value of the measured amount. The value includes an implicit precision in
            the presentation of the value.

        comparator: How the value should be understood and represented - whether the actual value
            is greater or less than the stated value due to measurement issues; e.g. if
            the comparator is "<" , then the real value is < stated value.

        unit: A human-readable form of the unit.

        system: The identification of the system that provides the coded form of the unit.

        code: A computer processable form of the unit in some unit representation system.
