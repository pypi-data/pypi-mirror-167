# py-adl

I created this program because I really like the idea of the original [adl](https://github.com/RaitaroH/adl) wrapper script for [anime-downloader](https://github.com/anime-dl/anime-downloader) and [trackma](https://github.com/z411/trackma), but wasn't able to use once I got over to windows and now here I'm with a python port of it

## Main differences

- The script is built to be natively used on both windows and linux.
- Instead of anime-downloader I'm using [animdl](https://github.com/justfoolingaround/animdl)

This is not supposped to be one on one port because some things just arent possible to be done in windows terminals (images).

## Features

- anime tracking using trackma
- use different providers
- use multiple possible video players
- update anime meta
- watch/download anime
